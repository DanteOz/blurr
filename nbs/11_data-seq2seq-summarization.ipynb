Barack Obama's latest campaign gambit follows a familiar line of attack as it uses Mitt Romney's private equity past to cast the Republican candidate as  greedy, job-killing corporate titan with little concern for the working class. The President is not the first of Mr Romney's opponents to try and paint the former governor of Massachusetts as a heartless uber-capitalist - even his Republican rivals used the same tactic during the heated primary battle. But Mr Obama's campaign seems to have been particularly unoriginal - as his attack ad is almost identical to one produced by Ted Kennedy for his Senate campaign against Mr Romney in 1994, featuring unemployed workers complaining about Bain Capital, the firm founded by Mr Romney. The timing of the Obama assault on private equity is also unfortunate, as on Monday night the President attended a fundraiser hosted by Democratic supporter Ham</td>\n",

Democratic legislators called for handling the 19-year-old suspect as a crime suspect rather than a war enemy, allowing the U.S. citizen the right to legal representation under federal law that could impose the death penalty. A closer look at their statements and arguments showed how politicians blend facts, conjecture and spin to push their side's agenda while countering arguments from across the aisle.

Voting 5-4 in each of two decisions, the justices struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples and cleared the way for gays and lesbians to once again marry in California. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whose husband signed DOMA into law in 1996, applauded the decision. \"By overturning the Defense of Marriage Act, the court recognized that discrimination towards any group holds us all back in our efforts to form a more perfect union,\" Clinton said in a joint statement with her husband, Bill Clinton.

An exhaustive search -- covering a mind-boggling 2.97 million square miles, which is nearly the size of the continental United States -- has yielded some clues, but no proof of where the Boeing 777 is or definitively what happened to it. The latest, most notable lead revolved around two large objects detected by satellite Sunday floating on waters over 1,400 miles off of Australia's west coast.
