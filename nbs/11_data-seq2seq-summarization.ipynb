Barack Obama's latest campaign gambit follows a familiar line of attack as it uses Mitt Romney's private equity past to cast the Republican candidate as  greedy, job-killing corporate titan with little concern for the working class. The President is not the first of Mr Romney's opponents to try and paint the former governor of Massachusetts as a heartless uber-capitalist - even his Republican rivals used the same tactic during the heated primary battle. But Mr Obama's campaign seems to have been particularly unoriginal - as his attack ad is almost identical to one produced by Ted Kennedy for his Senate campaign against Mr Romney in 1994, featuring unemployed workers complaining about Bain Capital, the firm founded by Mr Romney. The timing of the Obama assault on private equity is also unfortunate, as on Monday night the President attended a fundraiser hosted by Democratic supporter Ham</td>\n",

In particular, he called the claim by Ryan and other Republicans that $716 billion is being cut from Medicare to fund the health care bill \"simply not true.\" Ryan spoke to the same event shortly afterward, saying that Obama's contention that the health care law strengthened Medicare was \"just not true,\" adding that the legislation \"turned Medicare into a piggy bank for Obamacare.\" The debate over Medicare is a major issue in the November election campaign, especially in the vital batt</td>\n",

Later, federal agencies are expected to get phones for sending and receiving government cables while away from their offices, sources said. Eventually, local governments and corporations could give workers phones with similar software.

The plane flew as low as 12,000 feet at some point before it disappeared from radar, according to the source. The sharp turn seemed to be intentional, the source said, because executing it would have taken the Boeing 777 two minutes -- a time period during which the pilot or co-pilot could have sent an emergency signal if there had been a fire or other emergency onboard.

Voting 5-4 in each of two decisions, the justices struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples and cleared the way for gays and lesbians to once again marry in California. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whose husband signed DOMA into law in 1996, applauded the decision. \"By overturning the Defense of Marriage Act, the court recognized that discrimination towards any group holds us all back in our efforts to form a more perfect union,\" Clinton said in a joint statement with her husband, Bill Clinton.
