Chinese authorities had dragged her out of her home and down four flights of stairs, she said, restraining and beating her husband as he tried to come to her aid. They whisked her into a clinic, held her down on a bed and forced her to undergo an abortion. Her offense? Becoming pregnant with a second child, in violation of China's one-child policy. \"After the abortion, I felt empty, as if something was scooped out of me,\" Ji told a congressional panel in September. \"My husband and I had been so excited for our new baby. Now suddenly all that hope and joy and excitement disappeared.... I was very depressed and despondent. For a long time, whenever I thought about my lost child, I would cry.\" As she lay unconscious, she said, an IUD to prevent future pregnancies was inserted. The issue of forced abortions -- and in some cases, forced sterilizations -- in China has seized the spotlight in recent days with news of escaped activist Chen Guangcheng. Chen, a blind, self-taught lawyer, rose to fame in the late 1990s because of his advocacy for what he calls victims&lt;/s&gt;</td>\n",

That used to mean the beginning of an extremely difficult time in an LGBT person's life. But as gay baby boomers find more acceptance in mainstream society and continue to do what they've always done -- push to make a better world for the LGBT community -- their retirement options are slowly improving. That is, if they decide to retire at all. \"The notion of retirement has never been a part of my vocabulary,\" said Bob Witeck, CEO and co-founder of Witeck Communications. Nearly 61, Witeck has put some thought into what he should do with his strategic public relations and marketing firm as he gets older. Like many friends his age who are also entrepreneurs, he plans to keep working. \"Because I run a business, as I get older I can change the intensity of my engagement in the kinds of work I take on,\" Witeck said. \"I know I'm lucky that way, and I'm lucky in my personal life as well. My husband is 50, so I have a younger man to help me&lt;/s&gt;</td>\n",
