( henderson's death is no spoiler ; his name isn't revealed until his death scene. ) she seems to promptly forget him. someone's expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does. i think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that</td>\n",

       "      <td>the trouble with the book, \" memoirs of a geisha \" is that it had japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an american man's way of thinking. reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music, sets, and costumes yet performed by barnyard animals dressed in those costumesso far from japanese ways of thinking were the characters. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; the movie isn't about japan or real geisha. it is a story about a few american men's mistaken ideas about japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions. so what is this movie if it isn't about japan or geisha? is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? yes, but then why make it into an american fantasy? &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; there were so many missed opportunities. imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hang - ups, no connotations of sin about sex. sex is natural and normal. how is sex handled in this movie? right. like it was dirty. the closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? nope. one character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesn't want to get caught doing something dirty. such typical american puritanism has no place in a movie about japanese geisha. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; did sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off? nope. she lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block. of course she isn't supposed to enjoy it. and that is what i mean about this movie. why couldn't they have given her something to enjoy? why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong? &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; behind mameha the chairman was sayuri's secret patron, and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity. he could have rigged the auction and won her himself. nobu didn't even bid. so why did the chairman let that old codger win her and, reeking of old - man stink,</td>\n",

       "      <td>&lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; i'm sure things didn't exactly go the same way in the real life of homer hickam as they did in the film adaptation of his book, rocket boys, but the movie \" october sky \" ( an anagram of the book's title ) is good enough to stand alone. i have not read hickam's memoirs, but i am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation. the film, directed by joe johnston and written by lewis colick, records the story of teenager homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ), beginning in october of 1957. it opens with the sound of a radio broadcast, bringing news of the russian satellite sputnik, the first artificial satellite in orbit. we see a images of a blue - gray town and its people : mostly miners working for the olga coal company. one of the miners listens to the news on a hand - held radio as he enters the elevator shaft, but the signal is lost as he disappears into the darkness, losing sight of the starry sky above him. a melancholy violin tune fades with this image. we then get a jolt of elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting : october 5, 1957, coalwood, west virginia. homer and his buddies, roy lee cook ( william lee scott ) and sherman o'dell ( chad lindberg ), are talking about football tryouts. football scholarships are the only way out of the town, and working in the mines, for these boys. \" why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college, \" questions homer. roy lee replies, \" they're also the only ones who get the girls. \" homer doesn't make it in football like his older brother, so he is destined for the mines, and to follow in his father's footsteps as mine foreman. until he sees the dot of light streaking across the october sky. then he wants to build a rocket. \" i want to go into space, \" says homer. after a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother's ( natalie canerday ) fence, homer enlists the help of the nerdy quentin wilson ( chris owen ). quentin asks homer, \" what do you want to know about rockets? \" homer quickly anwers, \" everything. \" his science teacher at big creek high school, miss frieda riley ( laura dern ) greatly supports homer, and</td>\n",
