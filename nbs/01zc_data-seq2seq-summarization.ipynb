Named for the hospital in Buckinghamshire where Prof. Ludwig Guttmann's pioneering spinal injuries unit was based, the competitors in those initial Games -- 14 men and two women -- took part in a wheelchair archery contest. Many were military veterans injured on the battlefields of World War II. Just a year later, six teams competed at Stoke Mandeville -- with wheelchair netball, a forerunner of wheelchair basketball, being introduced -- as sport became a central part of a rehabilitation process that had been revolutionized by Guttmann.

The twin threats of climate change and human encroachment on natural environments are, however, threatening the existence of the country's rich wildlife. And there is a great deal to lose. In the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) World Conservation Monitoring Centre's list of megadiverse countries Mexico ranks 11th. The list represents a group of 17 countries that harbor the majority of the Earth's species and are therefore considered extremely biodiverse. From its coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea to its tropical jungles in Chiapas and the Yucatan peninsula and its deserts and prairies in the north, Mexico boasts an incredibly rich variety of flora and fauna. Some 574 out of 717 reptile species found in Mexico -- the most in any country -- can only be encountered within its borders. It is home to 502 types of mammals, 290 species of birds, 1,150 vari</td>\n",

By the time officers arrived at Ciancia's apartment Friday, he had already left -- as little as 45 minutes earlier -- for the airport, according to U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul. As authorities piece together Ciancia's actions leading up to the shooting, new details emerged Sunday from those close to the suspect. According to someone who knew Ciancia and his roommates well, Ciancia began asking one of his three roommates days before the shooting if he could get a ride to the airport. Ciancia told the roommate that his father, back in New Jersey, was sick and he needed to get home \"to go help take care of him,\" the source said.
