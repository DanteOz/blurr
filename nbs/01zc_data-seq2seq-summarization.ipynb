Many were military veterans injured on the battlefields of World War II.

The twin threats of climate change and human encroachment on natural environments are, however, threatening the existence of the country's rich wildlife. And there is a great deal to lose. In the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) World Conservation Monitoring Centre's list of megadiverse countries Mexico ranks 11th. The list represents a group of 17 countries that harbor the majority of the Earth's species and are therefore considered extremely biodiverse. From its coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea to its tropical jungles in Chiapas and the Yucatan peninsula and its deserts and prairies in the north, Mexico boasts an incredibly rich variety of flora and fauna. Some 574 out of 717 reptile species found in Mexico -- the most in any country -- can only be encountered within its borders. It is home to 502 types of mammals, 290 species of birds, 1,150 vari</td>\n",

He eats local, organic and fair-trade food and drives a Honda CR-Z hybrid sports car. You might call him green. Except he's not so green when he travels for his work at an education nonprofit and stays in a hotel, which happens about 10 weeks per year. There, he uses a new towel every day. And don't try to bribe him with a drink or dessert coupon to get him to reuse the same one. \"I could care less about rewards for environmentally conscious behavior unless it's miles,\" Condon wrote in an e-mail. If hotels can't convince a hybrid-driving recycling enthusiast like Condon to go green while traveling, how can they possibly convince everyone else? 9 glamorous movie-star hotels.
