      "      (CNN) -- For most Americans, mosquitoes are pests whose bites leave behind itchy bumps. But in other parts of the world, mosquitoes carry a disease called malaria that kills more than a million people each year. Mosquitoes, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa, may transmit malaria to humans. A new malaria vaccine that's about to begin human clinical trials is dependent on mosquitoes -- a whole lot of them. Bioengineers have been growing millions of mosquitoes in a sterile environment, letting them feed on malaria-infected blood, irradiating the bugs, extracting the disease-causing parasites and storing them for use in vaccines. The announcement of the Food and Drug Administration's approval for clinical trials comes just days before World Malaria Day, which is Saturday. Check out the World Health Organization's site about malaria goals worldwide . The vaccine is unique among other candidates in that it uses the entire parasite and not just parts of it, said Dr. Stephen Hoffman, chief executive and scientific officer at Sanaria Inc., the Maryland-based biotechnology firm developing the vaccine. This technique was first shown to be effective in the 1970s, but the technology didn't exist to mass-produce it for the millions of people who need it, said Dr.  Kirsten Lyke, principal investigator in the clinical trial site at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. At that time, people were immunized by being bitten by the irradiated mosquitoes. \"That is the only effective vaccine that anyone has ever really developed that works and does complete protection,\" said John Dame, chair of Infectious Diseases and Pathology at the University of Florida, who is not involved with the Sanaria trials. The vaccine takes the same basic approach as standard vaccines in use for diseases such as measles and polio. In those vaccines against viruses, weakened bacteria is injected, creating an immune response without causing illness. In the Sanaria vaccine, the body recognizes the malaria parasite as a foreign material, Lyke said. It goes to the liver, where a lot of the immune response is generated, but does not develop into a disease because the mosquito was irradiated, she said. Clinical trials will begin in May, Hoffman said, and will include 80 immunized individuals and 24 controls. About 3,000 mosquitoes were used to produce the vaccines for the first clinical trials, he said. If these trials are successful, researchers will initiate trials on adults in Africa, and then children. Among other vaccines in clinical trials currently, the one that is furthest along is RTS,S, developed by GlaxoSmithKline PLC. The company announced in December that this vaccine, based on a recombinant protein that uses part of the malaria parasite, was safely administered to African infants, with an efficacy of 65 percent in a three-month follow-up. Both the Sanaria and the GlaxoSmithKline projects receive support from the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative, a program at the nonprofit PATH established through an initial grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Dame, who used to be involved with the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine, said he would guess the Sanaria vaccine will be more effective, but clinical trials will provide more information. He also noted that mass distribution to developing countries would require appropriate infrastructure, and may be more difficult depending on how long the immunization lasts. Each year, 350 million to 500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most people who die from the disease are young children in Africa south of the Sahara. Symptoms of malaria include fever, chills and flu-like illness, the CDC said. Although preventive measures exist, such as insecticide-treated nets and medications, there is no licensed vaccine on the market. Moreover, effective treatments are largely too expensive for the people who need them in poor countries. The parasite has become resistant to cheaper treatments, Lyke said. \"Individuals living on $1 or $2 a day can't even afford $8 medication,\" Lyke said. The U.S. military also has a keen interest in a malaria vaccine. The antimalaria drugs available have side effects such as stomach aches, said Dr. Tom Richie, director of the Navy component of the U.S. military malaria vaccine program, who provides oversight to the clinical trials. \"Malaria has been one of the most significant infectious threats to our military personnel when we deploy to tropical areas,\" Richie said. The disease was the leading cause of casualties in the South Pacific theater during World War II, and also a major problem in the Vietnam War, he said. There are five species of the malaria parasite known to infect humans. One called Plasmodium falciparum causes the vast majority of cases. Malaria was eliminated in the United States in 1951, but there are still cases in the country, mostly from people who acquired it in high-risk countries. In 2002, there were 1,337 cases of malaria in the U.S., and all but five had been acquired abroad. An international team at the Malaria Atlas Project recently published what researchers say is the most comprehensive map ever illustrating global malaria risk. Researchers told CNN the map offers hope that it is possible to eradicate the disease in many parts of the world. Hoffman, former head of a U.S. Navy malaria vaccine team, started the Sanaria effort himself in the breakfast room of his house in 2003. The company now has a more official corporate headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. \"I thought that the world needed a malaria vaccine, there was no question this was the best way to make one,\" he said.\n",

      "      ((CNN) -- For most Americans, mosquitoes are pests whose bites leave behind itchy bumps. But in other parts of the world, mosquitoes carry a disease called malaria that kills more than a million people each year. Mosquitoes, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa, may transmit malaria to humans. A new malaria vaccine that's about to begin human clinical trials is dependent on mosquitoes -- a whole lot of them. Bioengineers have been growing millions of mosquitoes in a sterile environment, letting them feed on malaria-infected blood, irradiating the bugs, extracting the disease-causing parasites and storing them for use in vaccines. The announcement of the Food and Drug Administration's approval for clinical trials comes just days before World Malaria Day, which is Saturday. Check out the World Health Organization's site about malaria goals worldwide . The vaccine is unique among other candidates in that it uses the entire parasite and not just parts of it, said Dr. Stephen Hoffman, chief executive and scientific officer at Sanaria Inc., the Maryland-based biotechnology firm developing the vaccine. This technique was first shown to be effective in the 1970s, but the technology didn't exist to mass-produce it for the millions of people who need it, said Dr.  Kirsten Lyke, principal investigator in the clinical trial site at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. At that time, people were immunized by being bitten by the irradiated mosquitoes. \"That is the only effective vaccine that anyone has ever really developed that works and does complete protection,\" said John Dame, chair of Infectious Diseases and Pathology at the University of Florida, who is not involved with the Sanaria trials. The vaccine takes the same basic approach as standard vaccines in use for diseases such as measles and polio. In those vaccines against viruses, weakened bacteria is injected, creating an immune response without causing illness. In the Sanaria vaccine, the body recognizes the malaria parasite as a foreign material, Lyke said. It goes to the liver, where a lot of the immune response is generated, but does not develop into a disease because the mosquito was irradiated, she said. Clinical trials will begin in May, Hoffman said, and will include 80 immunized individuals and 24 controls. About 3,000 mosquitoes were used to produce the vaccines for the first clinical trials, he said. If these trials are successful, researchers will initiate trials on adults in Africa, and then children. Among other vaccines in clinical trials currently, the one that is furthest along is RTS,S, developed by GlaxoSmithKline PLC. The company announced in December that this vaccine, based on a recombinant protein that uses part of the malaria parasite, was safely administered to African infants, with an efficacy of 65 percent in a three-month follow-up. Both the Sanaria and the GlaxoSmithKline projects receive support from the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative, a program at the nonprofit PATH established through an initial grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Dame, who used to be involved with the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine, said he would guess the Sanaria vaccine will be more effective, but clinical trials will provide more information. He also noted that mass distribution to developing countries would require appropriate infrastructure, and may be more difficult depending on how long the immunization lasts. Each year, 350 million to 500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most people who die from the disease are young children in Africa south of the Sahara. Symptoms of malaria include fever, chills and flu-like illness, the CDC said. Although preventive measures exist, such as insecticide-treated nets and medications, there is no licensed vaccine on the market. Moreover, effective treatments are largely too expensive for the people who need them in poor countries. The parasite has become resistant to cheaper treatments, Lyke said. \"Individuals living on $1 or $2 a day can't even afford $8 medication,\" Lyke said. The U.S. military also has a keen interest in a malaria vaccine. The antimalaria drugs available have side effects such as stomach aches, said Dr. Tom Richie, director of the Navy component of the U.S. military malaria vaccine program, who provides oversight to the clinical trials. \"Malaria has been one of the most significant infectious threats to our military personnel when we deploy to tropical areas,\" Richie said. The disease was the leading cause of casualties in the South Pacific theater during World War II, and also a major problem in the Vietnam War, he said. There are five species of the malaria parasite known to infect humans. One called Plasmodium falciparum causes the vast majority of cases. Malaria was eliminated in the United States in 1951, but there are still cases in the country, mostly from people who acquired it in high-risk countries. In 2002, there were 1,337 cases of malaria in the U.S., and all but five had been acquired abroad. An international team at the Malaria Atlas Project recently published what researchers say is the most comprehensive map ever illustrating global malaria risk. Researchers told CNN the map offers hope that it is possible to eradicate the disease in many parts of the world. Hoffman, former head of a U.S. Navy malaria vaccine team, started the Sanaria effort himself in the breakfast room of his house in 2003. The company now has a more official corporate headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. \"I thought that the world needed a malaria vaccine, there was no question this was the best way to make one,\" he said., Sanaria Inc. is developing a malaria vaccine that uses the whole parasite .\n",

      "      [((CNN) -- For most Americans, mosquitoes are pests whose bites leave behind itchy bumps. But in other parts of the world, mosquitoes carry a disease called malaria that kills more than a million people each year. Mosquitoes, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa, may transmit malaria to humans. A new malaria vaccine that's about to begin human clinical trials is dependent on mosquitoes -- a whole lot of them. Bioengineers have been growing millions of mosquitoes in a sterile environment, letting them feed on malaria-infected blood, irradiating the bugs, extracting the disease-causing parasites and storing them for use in vaccines. The announcement of the Food and Drug Administration's approval for clinical trials comes just days before World Malaria Day, which is Saturday. Check out the World Health Organization's site about malaria goals worldwide . The vaccine is unique among other candidates in that it uses the entire parasite and not just parts of it, said Dr. Stephen Hoffman, chief executive and scientific officer at Sanaria Inc., the Maryland-based biotechnology firm developing the vaccine. This technique was first shown to be effective in the 1970s, but the technology didn't exist to mass-produce it for the millions of people who need it, said Dr.  Kirsten Lyke, principal investigator in the clinical trial site at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. At that time, people were immunized by being bitten by the irradiated mosquitoes. \"That is the only effective vaccine that anyone has ever really developed that works and does complete protection,\" said John Dame, chair of Infectious Diseases and Pathology at the University of Florida, who is not involved with the Sanaria trials. The vaccine takes the same basic approach as standard vaccines in use for diseases such as measles and polio. In those vaccines against viruses, weakened bacteria is injected, creating an immune response without causing illness. In the Sanaria vaccine, the body recognizes the malaria parasite as a foreign material, Lyke said. It goes to the liver, where a lot of the immune response is generated, but does not develop into a disease because the mosquito was irradiated, she said. Clinical trials will begin in May, Hoffman said, and will include 80 immunized individuals and 24 controls. About 3,000 mosquitoes were used to produce the vaccines for the first clinical trials, he said. If these trials are successful, researchers will initiate trials on adults in Africa, and then children. Among other vaccines in clinical trials currently, the one that is furthest along is RTS,S, developed by GlaxoSmithKline PLC. The company announced in December that this vaccine, based on a recombinant protein that uses part of the malaria parasite, was safely administered to African infants, with an efficacy of 65 percent in a three-month follow-up. Both the Sanaria and the GlaxoSmithKline projects receive support from the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative, a program at the nonprofit PATH established through an initial grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Dame, who used to be involved with the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine, said he would guess the Sanaria vaccine will be more effective, but clinical trials will provide more information. He also noted that mass distribution to developing countries would require appropriate infrastructure, and may be more difficult depending on how long the immunization lasts. Each year, 350 million to 500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most people who die from the disease are young children in Africa south of the Sahara. Symptoms of malaria include fever, chills and flu-like illness, the CDC said. Although preventive measures exist, such as insecticide-treated nets and medications, there is no licensed vaccine on the market. Moreover, effective treatments are largely too expensive for the people who need them in poor countries. The parasite has become resistant to cheaper treatments, Lyke said. \"Individuals living on $1 or $2 a day can't even afford $8 medication,\" Lyke said. The U.S. military also has a keen interest in a malaria vaccine. The antimalaria drugs available have side effects such as stomach aches, said Dr. Tom Richie, director of the Navy component of the U.S. military malaria vaccine program, who provides oversight to the clinical trials. \"Malaria has been one of the most significant infectious threats to our military personnel when we deploy to tropical areas,\" Richie said. The disease was the leading cause of casualties in the South Pacific theater during World War II, and also a major problem in the Vietnam War, he said. There are five species of the malaria parasite known to infect humans. One called Plasmodium falciparum causes the vast majority of cases. Malaria was eliminated in the United States in 1951, but there are still cases in the country, mostly from people who acquired it in high-risk countries. In 2002, there were 1,337 cases of malaria in the U.S., and all but five had been acquired abroad. An international team at the Malaria Atlas Project recently published what researchers say is the most comprehensive map ever illustrating global malaria risk. Researchers told CNN the map offers hope that it is possible to eradicate the disease in many parts of the world. Hoffman, former head of a U.S. Navy malaria vaccine team, started the Sanaria effort himself in the breakfast room of his house in 2003. The company now has a more official corporate headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. \"I thought that the world needed a malaria vaccine, there was no question this was the best way to make one,\" he said., Sanaria Inc. is developing a malaria vaccine that uses the whole parasite .\n",

      "The most advanced malaria vaccine, by GlaxoSmithKline, has been tested in Africa .), (Three brothers have confessed to involvement in the gang rape of two teenage girls in India, a police officer told CNN. The men have pleaded guilty to the rape charges but have not admitted to killing the girls, local police spokesman Mukesh Saxena said Sunday. All five known suspects, including two police officers, have been arrested, he said. The police complaint also names two unknown people in the case. Investigations are trying to determine their identity, Saxena said. The assault on the cousins, ages 14 and 16, sparked outrage in the community in Uttar Pradesh state. After being gang raped, they were hanged from a mango tree, police said. The initial post-mortem report suggests that the two girls were alive when they were hanged, Saxena told CNN on Wednesday. \"The (autopsy) report is the basis of our investigation. The cause of the death is also being verified further through various other forensic and scientific methods,\" he said. Villagers streamed into the homes of the girls' relatives, weeping behind their customary veils. The mother of one of the girls said her daughter wanted to become a doctor to escape grinding poverty. The attackers, she said, deserved the same fate that befell her daughter. \"Hang them in public,\" she said. CNN cannot identify the relatives or victims under Indian law. In the northern village where the attack occurred, crowds surrounded the girls for hours after their bodies were found on May 28. They accused authorities of siding with the suspects and blocked them from taking the girls down from their nooses unless arrests were made. In addition to possible rape and murder charges, the officers face charges of conspiracy in the crime and negligence of duty after villagers accused them of failing to respond when they first pinpointed the suspects. An autopsy confirmed that the girls had been raped and strangled, according to authorities. They were cremated the same day the bodies were found, in line with Hindu customs, Saxena said. \"We are scared,\" said Renu Devi, a woman in the village where the attack occurred. \"If this could happen to them, it could happen to us also.\" Police under scrutiny . Devi has reason to fear. The girls were in an orchard relieving themselves the night of May 27 when the attackers grabbed them, authorities said. Toilets are rare in the village, forcing women to wander away into fields in the dead of night. \"There's no toilet. Where can the girls go?\" shouted Jamuni Devi, another woman from the village. \"No one has done anything for sanitation.\" Indians have more access to mobile phones than to toilets, according to a United Nations report four years ago. \"India has some 545 million cell phones, enough to serve about 45% of the population,\" according to the U.N. But it also has the highest number of people in the world -- an estimated 620 million -- who defecate in the open, according to UNICEF. The lack of indoor plumbing leaves women in rural areas vulnerable to frequent rapes and beatings. \"It is a tragic irony to think that in India, a country now wealthy enough that roughly half of the people own phones, about half cannot afford the basic necessity and dignity of a toilet,\" said Zafar Adeel, chairman of the organization U.N.-Water. Unable to stop abduction . Some people saw the abduction but were unable to stop it, police spokesman Saxena said, citing witnesses. His account echoed that of the father of the older victim, who alleged that a scuffle broke out between a relative and the three brothers suspected of the attack. \"They scared my cousin away with a locally made pistol,\" he said. The daughter he lost was his only child. The victims' relatives accused local police of failing to respond and siding with the suspects when the parents reported the case. The allegations have fueled anger among the villagers. \"If police wanted, my daughter would have been alive today,\" he said. 'Endemic' violence . This Uttar Pradesh rape is the latest of several that have drawn the world's attention to India in recent years. The horrific gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi in late 2012 shook India, sparking campaigns against violent crimes against women in the country, the world's second most populous, after China. The case prompted protests in many cities, soul-searching in the media and changes to law. But shocking instances of sexual violence continue to come to light. \"Laws can only do so much when you have to end something which is as endemic and as entrenched as violence against women,\" said Divya Iyer, a senior researcher for Amnesty International in Bangalore, India. The country's new Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has said he wants to take steps to ensure that women are safe, particularly in rural India. But women's rights groups have criticized what they say is a lack of specific proposals to tackle the problem, suggesting that gender inequality doesn't appear to be high on his list of priorities.

      "\"We are scared,\" says Renu Devi, a woman in the village where the attack occurred .), ((CNN) -- Two dozen lions rescued from harrowing conditions at circuses in Bolivia have a new home in Colorado, where they will live outside of cages and roar at the distant Rocky Mountains. Animal Defenders International (ADI) brought them last week to Denver, where they were transported to the Wild Animal Sanctuary, to conclude its \"Operation Lion Ark.\" The flight followed the passage of a 2009 law in Bolivia that bans the use of any animals in circuses. The 25 felines are currently housed in a 15,000-square-foot temporary biosphere, complete with grass, trees and other natural features, at the sanctuary in Keenesburg, about 30 miles northeast of Denver. They're sleeping better, are getting exercise and have begun to roar in unison, \"which demonstrates they are beginning to bond as we expected,\" said Pat Craig, executive director of the sanctuary. The ADI campaign and airlift got a big financial boost from TV game show host Bob Barker. Barker and actress Jorja Fox of \"CSI\" described the campaign Wednesday night on HLN's \"Jane Velez-Mitchell. \"It is a true testament to the Bolivian people what they were able to accomplish quickly,\" Fox said of the law and the rescue of the lions, which were part of eight circuses. Of the 25 lions, 24 were seized from circuses, many the traveling variety. Eight were living in a cage pulled by a truck, Fox said, and at least two had never seen other lions. The sanctuary is building a permanent 80-acre fenced site for the lions, which will live in four prides, Craig told CNN. They'll get along just fine with the climate in Colorado, he said, because they are exposed to the cold in North Africa. Living in Bolivia put them in a much warmer climate that will require acclimation until they are released into the permanent living area in late March or April. \"It was a surprise to me to know that lions are genetically wired for winter,\" said Fox. The 320-acre sanctuary of rolling grasslands, split into habitats, houses more than 275 large carnivores, including bears, tigers and other big cats. The Wild Animal Sanctuary emphasizes its mission is to serve as a sanctuary, not for entertainment. \"It's a home for animals, not a zoo for people,\" Craig said. Animal rights activists and groups are optimistic that Bolivia's 2009 action will lead other countries to ban animals in circuses and change conditions in zoos. \"I'm against zoos. I consider them prisons for animals,\" Barker told HLN. The sanctuary uses proceeds from its annual 50,000 visitors to cover the costs of their visit, Craig said. \"We hope they become long-term contributors.\" About 80 percent of the carnivores at the facility, which costs about $2.5 million a year to operate, were in the United States when they were seized from deplorable or illegal situations, he added. Most of the lions will have a lifespan of about 21 to 23 years, double their expected longevity in the wild. That's largely because they have no predators or competition from within their population. Lionesses receive estrogen implants so that they won't go into heat. That reduces the competition and fighting among males. Craig praised Bolivia for taking action. \"This is the first country that stepped up,\" he said. He expects Peru, Ecuador and other countries to take steps that eliminate or limit the use of animals in circuses and other entertainment venues. Cities and states in the United States are taking a hard look at the treatment of elephants and carnivores, according to Craig. The 25 lions are adjusting well, appear calm and enjoy stretching their legs while running and playing. \"Like many rescued animals that come from extreme captive situations, they are quickly accepting all of the positive changes that are happening,\" Craig told CNN. \"There is nowhere to go but up when you have lived at the bottom, so they are open to grasping every opportunity to enjoy life that we present. This will continue all the way until they are roaming freely in large acreage habitats, when they can complete their journey.\" CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report ., Twenty-five lions have new home at Colorado sanctuary .\n",

      "Bob Barker helped fund the effort to move them .), ((CNN) -- Forget the extreme environmental campaigns involving chaining oneself to an oil refinery or egging local politicians. The next big thing of environmental campaigning? Aesthetics. A group of 20 artists decided to step away from slogans and campaigns and unveiled a sculpture exhibition designed to make suggestions, rather than demands. Called \"Pertaining to Things Natural\" the show at London's Chelsea Physic Garden puts together art pieces that respond to the environment and the current ecological debates. Cathy Ward and Eric Wright are among the artists involved in the show. Their sculpture \"Skyfield\" addresses the issue of sustainability. \"As populations expand, pressure increases to produce more food on the limited and shrinking land that is available for cultivation,\" Ward explains. \"Scientific advances in the genetics of plants as well as increased knowledge on the effects of diet on health are opening new and vital debates on our future,\" she says. Her bright pink, double deck structure might not convey that message straight away, but a closer look shows that the sculpture could be used as a corn grower, suggesting a solution to the lack of cultivated land. James P. Graham's \"Golden Cage\" is one of those more metaphoric pieces. The cage-like structure of volcanic rocks wrapped in gold wire symbolizes man's \"attempts to imprison and control nature,\" a much discussed theme within the environmental debate. The connection between art and environment is not a new one. From the pioneer Friedensreich Hundertwasser, who designed underground highways lined by trees and rooftop gardens, to sculptures made of recycled materials, creative souls have long tried to send out the environmental message. But this latest addition to the dialog between art and environment carries more subtle message. Sculptor Michael Shaw installed large inflatable balloons on trees. \"There is no 'Greenpeace message' in the piece,\" he says. \"But it relates to environment, it is responsive to it. Where the sculpture is depends on the wind.\" The curator of the show, David Worthington, says this is the way art can add to the environmental debate -- even without straightforward messages. \"We can affect people's consciousness about environment on intellectual level, through campaigns and information,\" he says and points out environmental groups around the world. \"But we can also do it on emotional level through art and creativity,\" he says. \"The emotional level is more powerful.\", Sculpture show aims to make people engage with nature .\n",
      "Curator David Worthington says art is capable of changing people's habits .\n",
      "Artists communicate through emotions, rather than by placing demands, he says .)]\n",

The twin threats of climate change and human encroachment on natural environments are, however, threatening the existence of the country's rich wildlife. And there is a great deal to lose. In the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) World Conservation Monitoring Centre's list of megadiverse countries Mexico ranks 11th. The list represents a group of 17 countries that harbor the majority of the Earth's species and are therefore considered extremely biodiverse. From its coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea to its tropical jungles in Chiapas and the Yucatan peninsula and its deserts and prairies in the north, Mexico boasts an incredibly rich variety of flora and fauna.

The smartphones are first being deployed to U.S. soldiers, people familiar with the project said. Later, federal agencies are expected to get phones for sending and receiving government cables while away from their offices, sources said. Eventually, local governments and corporations could give workers phones with similar software. The Army has been testing touchscreen devices at U.S. bases for nearly two years, said Michael McCarthy, a director for the Army's Brigade Modernization Command, in a phone interview.

The twin threats of climate change and human encroachment on natural environments are, however, threatening the existence of the country's rich wildlife. And there is a great deal to lose. In the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) World Conservation Monitoring Centre's list of megadiverse countries Mexico ranks 11th. The list represents a group of 17 countries that harbor the majority of the Earth's species and are therefore considered extremely biodiverse. From its coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea to its tropical jungles in Chiapas and the Yucatan peninsula and its deserts and prairies in the north, Mexico boasts an incredibly rich variety of flora and fauna. Some 574 out of 717 reptile species found in Mexico -- the most in any country -- can only be encountered within its borders.

They already know the answer. \"Yes.\" To these visitors, Disney is Mickey Mouse, princesses, magic and fun. It's happy memories of childhood brought back to life in your children, a clean place where the rides are safe and the Disney characters are always happy to pose for pictures with your kids. That's Deb Koma, who visited once as a child and walked back into the Magic Kingdom in the mid-1990s with her young son. \"It was so perfect, everybody was so happy, everything was so maintained,\" said Koma, who now works for the AllEars.net, an unofficial Disney planning and fan site. \"You were in a perfect fantasy world. That, and my little boy loved it.\" But for other vacationers, Disney inspires a firm \"no.\" To those travelers, Disney is merely a commercial machine built to sell tickets, overpriced toys and a stereotype of girls as princesses.
