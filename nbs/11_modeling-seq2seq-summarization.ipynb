In a new timeline provided by Carney to reporters on Monday, General Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler learned on April 24 of a pending Treasury inspector general's report on how IRS staff used criteria targeting conservative groups in assessing eligibility for tax-exempt status. According to Carney, Ruemmler told McDonough as well as other Treasury officials about the pending report. It was the first time the White House acknowledged that McDonough was aware of the report before it became public in early May. IRS: By the numbers. In addition, Carney made clear that the information Ruemmler received on April 24 included details of improper acts by IRS officials. At the same time, Carney emphasized that the information was preliminary and could have changed before the inspector general released his final report on May 14. Carney insisted no one -- including Ruemmler and McDonough -- told President Barack Obama anything about the inspector general's pending report before media reports about it began appearing on May 10. \"We knew the subject of the investigation&lt;/s&gt;</td>\n",

Operation Anvil, as the multinational mission is known, differs from past efforts because of its reliance on military outposts close to the front lines to provide quick responses. It is a strategy reminiscent of counterinsurgency tactics used by the U.S. military on battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan. In a two-month span, six people have been killed in the operation, including possibly four innocent civilians. Despite the controversial shootings, American and Honduran officials say they both are happy with their collaboration and consider Operation Anvil -- launched in April -- a success. As of Wednesday, authorities said, they had interdicted five planes, seized about 2,300 kilos of cocaine, and made seven arrests. Firearms, including military assault rifles, have also been seized. \"The amount of drugs seized and the disruption of narcotrafficking routes speak for themselves,\" said Jorge Ramon Hernandez Alcerro, the Honduran ambassador to the United States.

    "The men, dressed in black clothes and black ski masks, split into two groups during the raid on the Grand Casino \n",
    "Basel, Chief Inspector Peter Gill told CNN. One group tried to break into the casino's vault on the lower level \n",
    "but could not get in, but they did rob the cashier of the money that was not secured, he said. The second group \n",
    "of armed robbers entered the upper level where the roulette and blackjack tables are located and robbed the \n",
    "cashier there, he said. As the thieves were leaving the casino, a woman driving by and unaware of what was \n",
    "occurring unknowingly blocked the armed robbers' vehicles. A gunman pulled the woman from her vehicle, beat \n",
    "her, and took off for the French border. The other gunmen followed into France, which is only about 100 \n",
    "meters (yards) from the casino, Gill said. There were about 600 people in the casino at the time of the robbery. \n",
    "There were no serious injuries, although one guest on the Casino floor was kicked in the head by one of the \n",
    "robbers when he moved, the police officer said. Swiss authorities are working closely with French authorities, \n",
