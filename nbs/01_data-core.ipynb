And where do we get a list of examples with fastai? In the `before_batch_tfms`!  So I thought, \"Hey, why not allow folks to do everything dynamically at batch time without having to do any pre-processing in advance?\" The result being the ability to allow Blurr to do all the tokenization work for you at batch time.  The benefits include: *less code*, *faster mini-batch creation*, *less RAM utilization* and time spent tokenizing (really helps with very large datasets), and *more flexibility*."
