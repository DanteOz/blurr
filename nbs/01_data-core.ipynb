    "`HF_BeforeBatchTransform` was inspired by this [article](http://dev.fast.ai/tutorial.transformers). It handles both the tokenization and numericalization traditionally split apart in the fastai text DataBlock API. For huggingface tokenizers that require a prefix space, it will be included automatically. In its current incarnation, `HF_BeforeBatchTransform` can be used to tokenize multiple inputs (common in seq2seq models for tasks like summarization) and even apply different tokenizers and arguments to each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs can come in as a string or a list of tokens, the later being for tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER), where you want to predict the label of each token.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes re: on-the-fly batch-time tokenization**: The previous version of the library performed the tokenization/numericalization as a type transform when the raw data was read, and included a couple batch transforms to prepare the data for collation (e.g., to be made into a mini-batch). With this update, everything is done in a single batch transform.  Why?  Part of the inspiration had to do with the mechanics of the huggingrace tokenizer, in particular how by default it returns a collated mini-batch of data given a list of sequences. And where do we get a list of examples with fastai? In the batch transforms!  So I thought, hey, why not do everything dynamically at batch time?  And with a bit of tweaking, I got everything to work pretty well.  The result is less code, faster mini-batch creation, less RAM utilization and time spent tokenizing (really helps with very large datasets), and more flexibility."

       "1  This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is som...   \n",

For starters, there was a musical montage every five minutes. There was no character development. Every character was a stereotype.

The disappointing thing about this film is that it only concentrate on a short period of the man's life - interestingly enough the man's entire life would have made such an epic bio-pic that it is staggering to imagine the cost for production.<br /><br />Some posters elude to the flawed characteristics about the man, which are cheap shots.

It almost seems as a series of challenges set up to determine whether or not you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just paid. If you don't want to feel slighted you'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved, they've all seen better days, but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you'll lose pity for them just like you've alr...   \n",
