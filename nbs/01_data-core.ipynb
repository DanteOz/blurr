With this update, everything is done in a single batch transform.  Why?  Part of the inspiration had to do with the mechanics of the huggingrace tokenizer, in particular how by default it returns a collated mini-batch of data given a list of sequences. And where do we get a list of examples with fastai? In the batch transforms!  So I thought, hey, why not do everything dynamically at batch time?  And with a bit of tweaking, I got everything to work pretty well.  The result is less code, faster mini-batch creation, less RAM utilization and time spent tokenizing (really helps with very large datasets), and more flexibility."
