      <td>raising victor vargas : a review &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; you know, raising victor vargas is like sticking your hands into a big, steaming bowl of oatmeal. it's warm and gooey, but you're not sure if it feels right. try as i might, no matter how warm and gooey raising victor vargas became i was always aware that something didn't quite feel right. victor vargas suffers from a certain overconfidence on the director's part. apparently, the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a latino family on the lower east side, and an idyllic storyline would make the film critic proof. he was right, but it didn't fool me. raising victor vargas is the story about a seventeen - year old boy called, you guessed it, victor vargas ( victor rasuk ) who lives his teenage years chasing more skirt than the rolling stones could do in all the years they've toured. the movie starts off in ` ugly fat'donna's bedroom where victor is sure to seduce her, but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his best - friend harold ( kevin rivera ) comes - a - looking for him. caught in the attempt by harold and his sister, victor vargas runs off for damage control. yet even with the embarrassing implication that he's been boffing the homeliest girl in the neighborhood, nothing dissuades young victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat. on a hot, new york city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where victor's eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young nymph judy ( judy marte ), who's not just pretty, but a strong and independent too. the relationship that develops between victor and judy becomes the focus of the film. the story also focuses on victor's family that is comprised of his grandmother or abuelita ( altagracia guzman ), his brother nino ( also played by real life brother to victor, silvestre rasuk ) and his sister vicky ( krystal rodriguez ). the action follows victor between scenes with judy and scenes with his family. victor tries to cope with being an oversexed pimp - daddy, his feelings for judy and his grandmother's conservative catholic upbringing. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; the problems that arise from raising victor vargas are a few, but glaring errors. throughout the film you get to know certain characters like vicky, nino, grandma, judy and even</td>

      <td>many neglect that this isn't just a classic due to the fact that it's the first 3d game, or even the first shoot -'em - up. it's also one of the first stealth games, one of the only ( and definitely the first ) truly claustrophobic games, and just a pretty well - rounded gaming experience in general. with graphics that are terribly dated today, the game thrusts you into the role of b. j. ( don't even * think * i'm going to attempt spelling his last name! ), an american p. o. w. caught in an underground bunker. you fight and search your way through tunnels in order to achieve different objectives for the six episodes ( but, let's face it, most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon, surround you with nazis and send you out to waste one of the nazi leaders ). the graphics are, as i mentioned before, quite dated and very simple. the least detailed of basically any 3d game released by a professional team of creators. if you can get over that, however ( and some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you ), then you've got one heck of a good shooter / sneaking game. the game play consists of searching for keys, health and ammo, blasting enemies ( aforementioned nazis, and a " boss enemy " per chapter ) of varying difficulty ( which, of course, grows as you move further in the game ), unlocking doors and looking for secret rooms. there is a bonus count after each level is beaten... it goes by how fast you were ( basically, if you beat the'par time ', which is the time it took a tester to go through the same level ; this can be quite fun to try and beat, and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in, they are even challenging after many play - throughs ), how much nazi gold ( treasure ) you collected and how many bad guys you killed. basically, if you got 100 % of any of aforementioned, you get a bonus, helping you reach the coveted high score placings. the game ( mostly, but not always ) allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing... stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see. you can either run or walk, and amongst your weapons is also a knife... running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard, as</td>

" why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college, " questions homer. roy lee replies, " they're also the only ones who get the girls.

<li>Added LOTS of examples (using low/high-level APIs, using Hugging Face datasets, and handling all the GLUE tasks)</li>
<li>Updated setup.py so you can now use Blurr on Windows (H/T to @EinAeffchen for the fix)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>06/16/2021</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated to work with fastai 2.4</li>
<li>Removed <code>blurr_summary</code> as <code>Learner.summary</code> works with fastai 2.4</li>
<li>Updated <code>Learner.lr_find</code> code in docs to the updated API in fastai 2.4</li>

<ul>
<li>Updated to work with Huggingface 4.6.x</li>
<li>Added MLM fine-tuning</li>
<li>Reorganized code/docs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>05/04/2021</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The "May the Fourth be with you" release:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated to work with Huggingface 4.5.x and Fastai 2.3.1 (there is a bug in 2.3.0 that breaks blurr so make sure you are using the latest)</li>
<li>Fixed Github issues <a href="https://github.com/ohmeow/blurr/issues/36">#36</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ohmeow/blurr/issues/34">#34</a></li>
<li>Misc. improvements to get blurr in line with the upcoming Huggingface 5.0 release</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A few <strong>breaking changes</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><code>BLURR_MODEL_HELPER</code> is now just <a href="/blurr/utils.html#BLURR"><code>BLURR</code></a></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Task specific auto models need to be built using the new Huggingface <code>AutoModelFor&lt;Insert task here&gt;</code> classes. The docs have been updated to show you how it works; the prior way of building such models not longer works.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>12/31/2020</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The "Goodbye 2020" release with lots of goodies for blurr users:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the Seq2Seq models to use some of the latest huggingface bits like <code>tokenizer.prepare_seq2seq_batch</code>.</li>
<li>Separated out the Seq2Seq and Token Classification metrics into metrics-specific callbacks for a better separation of concerns. As a best practice, you should now <em>only</em> use them as <code>fit_one_cycle</code>, etc.. callbacks rather than attach them to your <code>Learner</code>.</li>
<li><strong>NEW</strong>: Translation are now available in blurr, joining causal language modeling and summarization in our core Seq2Seq stack</li>
<li><strong>NEW</strong>: Integration of huggingface's Seq2Seq metrics (rouge, bertscore, meteor, bleu, and sacrebleu). Plenty of info on how to set this up in the docs.</li>
<li><strong>NEW</strong>: Added <a href="/blurr/data-seq2seq-core.html#default_text_gen_kwargs"><code>default_text_gen_kwargs</code></a>, a method that given a huggingface config, model, and task (optional), will return the default/recommended kwargs for any text generation models.</li>
<li>A lot of code cleanup (e.g., refactored naming and removal of redundant code into classes/methods)</li>
<li><strong>More model support</strong> and <strong>more tests</strong> across the board!  Check out the docs for more info</li>
<li>Misc. validation improvements and bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I'm sure there is plenty I can do to make this library better, please don't hesitate to join in and help the effort by submitting PRs, pointing out problems with my code, or letting me know what and how I can improve things generally. Some models, like mbart and mt5 for example, aren't giving good results and I'd love to get any and all feedback from the community on how to resolve such issues ... so hit me up, I promise I won't bit :)</p>
<p><strong>12/20/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated <a href="/blurr/modeling-core.html#Learner.blurr_predict"><code>Learner.blurr_predict</code></a> and <a href="/blurr/modeling-token-classification.html#Learner.blurr_predict_tokens"><code>Learner.blurr_predict_tokens</code></a> to support single or multiple items</li>
<li>Added ONNX support for sequence classification, token classification, and question/answering tasks. <code>blurrONNX</code> provides ONNX friendly variants of <a href="/blurr/modeling-core.html#Learner.blurr_predict"><code>Learner.blurr_predict</code></a> and <a href="/blurr/modeling-token-classification.html#Learner.blurr_predict_tokens"><code>Learner.blurr_predict_tokens</code></a> in the form of <code>blurrONNX.predict</code> and <code>blurrONNX.predict_tokens</code> respectively.  Like their Learner equivalents, these methods support single or multiple items for inferece.  See the docs/code for examples and speed gains you get with ONNX.</li>
<li>Added quantization support when converting your blurr models to ONNX.</li>
<li>Requires fast.ai &gt;= 2.1.5 and huggingface transformers &gt;= 4.x</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>12/12/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated to work with the latest version of fast.ai (2.1.8) and huggingface transformers &gt;= 4.x</li>
<li>Fixed <code>Learner.blurr_summary</code> to work with fast.ai &gt;= 2.1.8</li>
<li>Fixed inclusion of <code>add_prefix_space</code> in tokenizer <code>BLURR_MODEL_HELPER</code></li>
<li>Fixed token classification <code>show_results</code> for tokenizers that add a prefix space</li>
<li>Notebooks run with environment variable "TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false" to avoid fast tokenizer warnings</li>
<li>Updated docs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>11/12/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated documentation</li>
<li>Updated model callbacks to support mixed precision training regardless of whether you are calculating the loss yourself or letting huggingface do it for you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>11/10/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Major update just about everywhere to facilitate a breaking change in fastai's treatment of <code>before_batch</code> transforms.</li>
<li>Reorganized code as I being to work on LM and other text2text tasks</li>
<li>Misc. fixes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10/08/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated all models to use <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/output.html">ModelOutput</a> classes instead of traditional tuples. <code>ModelOutput</code> attributes are assigned to the appropriate fastai bits like <code>Learner.pred</code> and <code>Learner.loss</code> and anything else you've requested the huggingface model to return is available via the <code>Learner.blurr_model_outputs</code> dictionary (see next two bullet items)</li>
<li>Added ability to grab attentions and hidden state from <code>Learner</code>. You can get at them via <code>Learner.blurr_model_outputs</code> dictionary if you tell <a href="/blurr/modeling-core.html#BaseModelWrapper"><code>BaseModelWrapper</code></a> to provide them.</li>
<li>Added <code>model_kwargs</code> to <a href="/blurr/modeling-core.html#BaseModelWrapper"><code>BaseModelWrapper</code></a> should you need to request a huggingface model to return something specific to it's type. These outputs will be available via the <code>Learner.blurr_model_outputs</code> dictionary as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>09/16/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Major overhaul to do <em>everything</em> at batch time (including tokenization/numericalization). If this backfires, I'll roll everything back but as of now, I think this approach not only meshes better with how huggingface tokenization works and reduce RAM utilization for big datasets, but also opens up opportunities for incorporating augmentation, building adversarial models, etc....  Thoughts?</li>
<li>Added tests for summarization bits</li>
<li>New change may require some small modifications (see docs or ask on issues thread if you have problems you can't fiture out).  I'm NOT doing a release until pypi until folks have a chance to work with the latest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>09/07/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added tests for question/answer and summarization transformer models</li>
<li>Updated summarization to support BART, T5, and Pegasus</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>08/20/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated everything to work latest version of fastai (tested against 2.0.0)</li>
<li>Added batch-time padding, so that by default now, <code>HF_TokenizerTransform</code> doesn't add any padding tokens and all huggingface inputs are padded simply to the max sequence length in each batch rather than to the max length (passed in and/or acceptable to the model).  This should create efficiencies across the board, from memory consumption to GPU utilization.  The old tried and true method of padding during tokenization requires you to pass in <code>padding='max_length</code> to <a href="/blurr/data-core.html#TextBlock"><code>TextBlock</code></a>.</li>
<li>Removed code to remove fastai2 @patched summary methods which had previously conflicted with a couple of the huggingface transformers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>08/13/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated everything to work latest transformers and fastai</li>
<li>Reorganized code to bring it more inline with how huggingface separates out their "tasks".</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>07/06/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated everything to work huggingface&gt;=3.02</li>
<li>Changed a lot of the internals to make everything more efficient and performant along with the latest version of huggingface ... meaning, I have broken things for folks using previous versions of blurr :).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>06/27/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simplified the <code>BLURR_MODEL_HELPER.get_hf_objects</code> method to support a wide range of options in terms of building the necessary huggingface objects (architecture, config, tokenizer, and model).  Also added <code>cache_dir</code> for saving pre-trained objects in a custom directory.</li>
<li>Misc. renaming and cleanup that may break existing code (please see the docs/source if things blow up)</li>
<li>Added missing required libraries to requirements.txt (e.g., nlp)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>05/23/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Initial support for text generation (e.g., summarization, conversational agents) models now included. Only tested with BART so if you try it with other models before I do, lmk what works ... and what doesn't</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>05/17/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Major code restructuring to make it easier to build out the library.</li>
<li><code>HF_TokenizerTransform</code> replaces <code>HF_Tokenizer</code>, handling the tokenization and numericalization in one place.  DataBlock code has been dramatically simplified.</li>
<li>Tokenization correctly handles huggingface tokenizers that require <code>add_prefix_space=True</code>.</li>
<li><a href="/blurr/modeling-core.html#BaseModelCallback"><code>BaseModelCallback</code></a> and <a href="/blurr/modeling-core.html#BaseModelCallback"><code>BaseModelCallback</code></a> are required and work together in order to allow developers to tie into any callback friendly event exposed by fastai2 and also pass in named arguments to the huggingface models.</li>
<li><code>show_batch</code> and <code>show_results</code> have been updated for Question/Answer and Token Classification models to represent the data and results in a more easily intepretable manner than the defaults.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>05/06/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Initial support for Token classification (e.g., NER) models now included</li>
<li>Extended fastai's <code>Learner</code> object with a <code>predict_tokens</code> method used specifically in token classification</li>
<li><a href="/blurr/modeling-core.html#BaseModelCallback"><code>BaseModelCallback</code></a> can be used (or extended) instead of the model wrapper to ensure your inputs into the huggingface model is correct (recommended). See docs for examples (and thanks to fastai's Sylvain for the suggestion!)</li>
<li><code>HF_Tokenizer</code> can work with strings or a string representation of a list (the later helpful for token classification tasks)</li>
<li><code>show_batch</code> and <code>show_results</code> methods have been updated to allow better control on how huggingface tokenized data is represented in those methods</li>
