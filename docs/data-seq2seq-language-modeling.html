summary: "This module contains the bits required to use the fastai DataBlock API and/or mid-level data processing pipelines to organize your data for causal and masked language modeling tasks. This includes things like training BERT from scratch or fine-tuning a particular pre-trained LM on your own corpus."

<p>Our <code>HF_CausalLMBeforeBatchTransform</code> allows us to update the input's <code>labels</code> and our targets appropriately given a causal LM task.</p>
<p>The <code>labels</code> argument allows you to forgo calculating the loss yourself by letting huggingface return it for you should you choose to do that. Padding tokens are set to -100 by default (e.g., <code>CrossEntropyLossFlat().ignore_index</code>) and prevent cross entropy loss from considering token prediction for tokens it should ... i.e., the padding tokens.

      <td>\n = Bob Dylan = \n \n Bob Dylan ( / &lt;unk&gt; / ; born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941 ) is an American singer @-@ songwriter, artist and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest, although Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation. Nevertheless, early songs such as " Blowin'in the Wind " and " The Times They Are a @-@ &lt;unk&gt;'" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti @-@ war movements. After he left his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six @-@ minute single " Like a Rolling Stone " altered the range of popular music in 1965. His mid @-@ 1960s recordings, backed by rock musicians, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting &lt;unk&gt; and criticism from others in the folk movement. \n Dylan's lyrics have incorporated various political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the performances of Little Richard and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Dylan has amplified and &lt;unk&gt; musical genres. His recording career, spanning more than 50 years, has explored the traditions in American song — from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but songwriting is considered his greatest contribution. \n Since 1994, Dylan has published six books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. As a musician, Dylan has sold more than 100 million records, making him one of the best @-@ selling artists of all time. He has also received numerous awards including eleven Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Minnesota Music Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for " his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.

      <td>\n = Battle of Romani = \n \n The Battle of Romani was the last ground attack of the Central Powers on the Suez Canal at the beginning of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign during the First World War. The battle was fought between 3 and 5 August 1916 near the Egyptian town of Romani and the site of ancient Pelusium on the Sinai Peninsula, 23 miles ( 37 km ) east of the Suez Canal. This victory by the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division and the Anzac Mounted Division of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force ( EEF ) over a joint Ottoman and German force, which had marched across the Sinai, marked the end of the Defence of the Suez Canal campaign, also known as the Offensive zur &lt;unk&gt; des &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which had begun on 26 January 1915. \n This British Empire victory, the first against the Ottoman Empire in the war, ensured the safety of the Suez Canal from ground attacks, and ended the Central Powers'ambitions of disrupting traffic through the canal by gaining control of the strategically important northern approaches to the Suez Canal. The pursuit by the Anzac Mounted Division which ended at Bir el Abd on 12 August began the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Thereafter, the Anzac Mounted Division supported by the Imperial Camel Brigade were on the offensive, pursuing the German and Ottoman army many miles across the Sinai Peninsula, reversing in a most &lt;unk&gt; manner the defeat suffered at Katia three months earlier. \n From late April 1916, after a German @-@ led Ottoman force attacked British yeomanry at Katia, British Empire forces in the region at first doubled from one brigade to two and then grew as rapidly as the developing infrastructure could support them. The construction of the railway and a water pipeline soon enabled an infantry division to join the light horse and mounted rifle brigades at Romani. During the heat of summer, regular mounted patrols and reconnaissance were carried out from their base at Romani, while the infantry constructed an extensive series of defensive redoubts. On 19 July, the advance of a large German, Austrian and Ottoman force across the northern Sinai was reported. From 20 July until the battle began, the Australian 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades took turns pushing out to clash with the advancing hostile column. \n During the night of 3 / 4 August 1916, the advancing force including the German Pasha I formation and the Ottoman 3rd Infantry Division launched an attack from Katia on Romani. Forward troops quickly became engaged with the screen established by the 1st Light Horse Brigade ( Anzac Mounted Division ). During fierce fighting before dawn on 4 August, the Australian light horsemen were forced to slowly retire. At daylight, their line was reinforced by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, and about mid morning, the 5th Mounted Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade joined the battle. Together these four brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division, managed to contain and direct the determined attackers into deep sand. Here the attackers came within range of the strongly entrenched 52nd ( Lowland ) Division defending Romani and the railway. &lt;unk&gt; resistance by all these EEF formations, the deep sand, the heat and thirst prevailed, and the German, Austrian and Ottoman advance was checked. Although the attacking force fought strongly to maintain its positions the next morning, by nightfall they had been pushed back to their starting point at Katia. The retiring force was pursued by the Anzac Mounted Division between 6 and 9 August, during which the Ottomans and Germans forces fought a number of strong rearguard actions against the advancing Australian light horse, British yeomanry and New Zealand mounted rifle brigades. The pursuit ended on 12 August, when the German and Ottoman force abandoned their base at Bir el Abd and retreated back to El Arish. \n \n = = Background = = \n \n At the beginning of the First World War, the Egyptian police controlling the Sinai Peninsula had withdrawn, leaving the area largely unprotected.
