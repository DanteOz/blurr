summary: "This module contains the bits required to use the fastai DataBlock API and/or mid-level data processing pipelines to organize your data for causal and masked language modeling tasks. This includes things like training BERT from scratch or fine-tuning a particular pre-trained LM on your own corpus."

<p>The <code>labels</code> argument allows you to forgo calculating the loss yourself by letting huggingface return it for you should you choose to do that.

      <td>\n = Bob Dylan = \n \n Bob Dylan ( / &lt;unk&gt; / ; born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941 ) is an American singer @-@ songwriter, artist and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest, although Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation. Nevertheless, early songs such as " Blowin'in the Wind " and " The Times They Are a @-@ &lt;unk&gt;'" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti @-@ war movements. After he left his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six @-@ minute single " Like a Rolling Stone " altered the range of popular music in 1965. His mid @-@ 1960s recordings, backed by rock musicians, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting &lt;unk&gt; and criticism from others in the folk movement. \n Dylan's lyrics have incorporated various political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the performances of Little Richard and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Dylan has amplified and &lt;unk&gt; musical genres. His recording career, spanning more than 50 years, has explored the traditions in American song — from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but songwriting is considered his greatest contribution. \n Since 1994, Dylan has published six books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. As a musician, Dylan has sold more than 100 million records, making him one of the best @-@ selling artists of all time. He has also received numerous awards including eleven Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Minnesota Music Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for " his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.

      <td>\n = Guitar Hero = \n \n The Guitar Hero series ( sometimes referred to as the Hero series ) is a series of music rhythm games first published in 2005 by RedOctane and Harmonix, and distributed by Activision, in which players use a guitar @-@ shaped game controller to simulate playing lead, bass guitar, and rhythm guitar across numerous rock music songs. Players match notes that scroll on @-@ screen to colored fret buttons on the controller, strumming the controller in time to the music in order to score points, and keep the virtual audience excited. The games attempt to mimic many features of playing a real guitar, including the use of fast @-@ fingering hammer @-@ &lt;unk&gt; and pull @-@ offs and the use of the whammy bar to alter the pitch of notes. Most games support single player modes, typically a Career mode to play through all the songs in the game, and both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes. With the introduction of Guitar Hero World Tour in 2008, the game includes support for a four @-@ player band including vocals and drums. The series initially used mostly cover versions of songs created by &lt;unk&gt; Sound, but most recent titles feature soundtracks that are fully master recordings, and in some cases, special re @-@ recordings, of the songs. Later titles in the series feature support for downloadable content in the form of new songs. \n In 2005, RedOctane, a company specializing in the manufacture of unique game controllers, was inspired to create Guitar Hero based on RedOctane's experience creating hardware for Konami's Guitar Freaks arcade game. They enlisted Harmonix, who previously developed several music video games, for development assistance. The first game in the series was made on a budget of $ 1 million. The series became extremely successful, leading to the acquisition of RedOctane by Activision in 2007. Harmonix was acquired by MTV Games and went on to create the Rock Band series of music games in the same vein as Guitar Hero. Activision brought Neversoft ( primarily known for their Tony Hawk series of &lt;unk&gt; games ) on board for future development duties. Additional companies, such as Budcat Creations and Vicarious Visions have assisted in the adaptation of the games for other systems. \n The series currently has eight major releases ( six Guitar Hero games, two DJ Hero games and Band Hero ) and five expansions on gaming consoles. There are spin @-@ offs for Windows and Macintosh systems, mobile phones, the Nintendo DS ( the Guitar Hero : On Tour series ), and an arcade game. The Guitar Hero franchise was a primary brand during the emergence of the popularity of rhythm games as a cultural phenomenon in North America. Such games have been utilized as a learning and development tool for medical purposes. The first game in the series was considered by several journalists to be one of the most influential video games of the first decade of the 21st century. The series has sold more than 25 million units worldwide, earning US $ 2 billion at retail, claimed by Activision to be the 3rd largest game franchise after the Mario and &lt;unk&gt; NFL franchises ; the third main title of the series, Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock is also claimed by Activision to be the first single video game title to exceed $ 1 billion in sales. \n Despite early success, the series, along with the overall rhythm game genre, suffered from poor sales starting in 2009. Activision had stated in early 2011 that the series was on hiatus for 2011, while a seventh main title in the series was under development ; this title was later cancelled due to the poor quality of the emerging product. Activision later shut down sales of the series'downloadable content, although users who purchased material from it previously may still play what they bought. \n In 2015, Activision announced the first new title to the series in 5 years, Guitar Hero Live, released in October 2015.
